# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from images. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and evaluated on a non-MNIST handwritten dataset to test real-world generalization.

A web application is deployed using Streamlit to allow users to upload handwritten digit images and receive predictions.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- 2 Convolution layers + MaxPooling
- Fully connected layers
- Softmax classification

---

## 📊 Datasets Used
- MNIST Dataset (Training)
- Non-MNIST Handwritten Dataset (Testing)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit

---

## 🚀 Web App
Users can upload an image of a handwritten digit, and the model predicts the digit in real time.

---

## 📈 Results
- MNIST Accuracy: ~99.12
- Non-MNIST Accuracy: Lower (expected due to domain shift)

---

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Data augmentation
- Better preprocessing
